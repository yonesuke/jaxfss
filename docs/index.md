`jaxfss` is a **finite-size scaling analysis** package.
It is built up on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax).

## Finite-Size Scaling Analysis
The physical quantity near a critical point in a finite-size system obeys the scaling law written as

$$
A(T,L)=L^{-c_{2}}F[(T-T_{\mathrm{c}})L^{c_{1}}]
$$

where $A(T, L)$ is a physical quantity at temperature $T$ in a finite-size system of which size is $L$. $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is a critical temperature. The exponent $c_1$ and $c_2$ are critical exponents.
Here $F[\cdot]$ is a scaling function. Unfortunately, we do not know the scaling functionâ€™s form in advance. Thus, we need to infer not only the value of critical temperature and exponents but also the scaling function itself from given data.

`jaxfss` is a package for those who need to analyze critical phenomena and calculate the critical point and critical exponents from the finite system size data.
The basic idea is that the scaling function is well approximated by some neural network function.
It is made up of JAX and Flax, and you can easily use.
The idea of this package is so simple that you can extend it to your need if it is not sufficient for you.
